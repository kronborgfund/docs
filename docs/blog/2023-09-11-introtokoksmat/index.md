# Why Koksmat?
I need helping hands to make the quality of my work better, and to be able to share it with others.  So come and collaborate with me (hoppefully us) on making better solutions for the Office Digital Workplace.

I like to welcome you to Koksmat. This is not a blog about food and cooking. It is a blog about software development and other things that I like to do. I will try to not only write, but also support you with video and real code.

## What does Koksmat stand for?


Koksmat is a Danish word that means "Chef's assistance". I found it fitting for my purpose as it for most people doesn't mean a thing, it is pronounced identitically in at least some languages (tested in Serbo Croatian and US languages).

It also reflects to my early life. When I was aged 17, I actually worked as a Koksmat on the ferries crossing from Aarhus to Kalundborg. Remembering preparing a mix of 30 kg potatoes and 10 kg mayonaise together with a 1 kilo of spices, not the coolest dish ever made as the potatoes was poured in from a 3 kg bag.

Another meaning of koksmat is in english "Cooks Hand", which inspired me to inititally make a logo with a hand reaching out to help. But it turned out to look closer so someone begging for food. So I decided to go for the Chefs hat instead.

So this is really about giving each other a helping hand in our daily work.

## Why now?
[TL;DR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr); Why not. 

The much longer story is related to my uncertainty about my self. A year a go I got diagnosed with **autisme** which have turned to be a bleshing for me. I really made me understand myself so much better, and also made me super confident that I have some talents which make is possible for me to do what I do.

## What is in it for you?

I have made so many solutions during my carreer, but until recently haven't found the right recipe for sharing it with others. I have tried to make a blog, but it is not really my thing. I have tried to make videos, but it is not really my thing either. I have tried to make code samples, but it is not really my thing either. Spebd years with Logic Apps, PowerApps and Power Automate, but it is not really make it nice through a product life cycle. What I love though, is Lists in SharePoint.

But trying to develop something which combines all of this, I think I have found something which I can do, resulting in the GitHub organization [Koksmat](https://www.github.com/koksmat-com).
