# Group Builder

Do you need to send emails to a large number of recipients in your organization? Do you want to create distribution lists based on various criteria, such as organization level, reporting structure, location, and country? Do you want to avoid the hassle of manually adding or removing members from your lists? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you might be interested in Group Builder, a new tool that simplifies the process of creating and managing distribution lists.

Group Builder is a tool that uses an Excel file containing email addresses and metadata, such as name, organization level, manager, work site, address, and country. Based on this file, Group Builder generates distribution list names, each with a unique identity that consists of a prefix and the hash value of the display name. This ensures that the alias does not conflict with the limitations of Exchange. Group Builder also creates contact objects for any SMTP addresses that do not match the DNS entries in the tenant.

Finally, Group Builder either creates or deletes the groups, and updates the member list in one step. You can use Group Builder to create distribution lists for various purposes, such as communication, collaboration, reporting, and analysis. Group Builder is easy to use, fast, and reliable. It saves you time and effort, and helps you reach your target audience more effectively.
