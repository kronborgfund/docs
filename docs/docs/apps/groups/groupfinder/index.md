# Group Finder

Introducing Group Finder

Have you ever struggled to find the right people to include in your email or meeting invitation? Do you want to reach out to a specific group of employees or managers based on their business unit, level, location, team name, or reporting to? If so, you might want to try Group Finder, a new tool that can help you find relevant groups with ease.

You might have had problems with technical limitations in Outlook / Exchange preventing you from sending to more than a 1000 recipients in one mail. [See Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#receiving-and-sending-limits)

Use [Group Builder](../groupbuilder/) to bypass this limitation.
